# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that execute automatically when predetermined conditions are met. They facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of an agreement without the need for intermediaries.

## Characteristics

- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed once deployed, ensuring the integrity of the contract.
- **Transparent**: Code is visible to all participants, promoting trust.
- **Self-Executing**: Automate processes when conditions are satisfied.
- **Trustless**: Eliminate the need for a central authority.

---

## Components

- **Functions**: Perform specific actions.
- **Visibility**: Public, private, internal, or external.
- **State Variables**: Store data permanently on the blockchain.
- **Modifiers**: Alter the behavior of functions (e.g., access control).
- **Events**: Emit logs that can be captured by off-chain applications.

## Development Languages

### [**Solidity**](https://soliditylang.org/)
- **Syntax**: Similar to JavaScript.
- **Features**: Supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types.

### [**Vyper**](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/#)
- **Syntax**: Pythonic and aims for simplicity.
- **Features**: Emphasizes security and auditability.

## Development Tools

- [**Remix IDE**](https://remix.ethereum.org): Online editor for writing and testing smart contracts.
- [**Truffle Suite**](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/): Framework for development, testing, and deployment.
- [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/): Development environment with debugging and testing features.

## Security Considerations

### **Common Vulnerabilities**
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Exploits recursive calls.
- **Integer Overflows/Underflows**: Numeric errors.
- **Access Control Issues**: Unauthorized access to functions.

### **Best Practices**
- **Audit Contracts**: Regularly review code.
- **Use Safe Math Libraries**: Prevent numeric errors.
- **Follow Design Patterns**: Such as [Checks-Effects-Interactions](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html).
