# **6. Metaverse Basics**

The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality. It encompasses a wide range of virtual experiences, environments, and assets that are interconnected, allowing users to interact in real-time across various platforms.

## **Key Concepts**

- **Virtual Worlds**: Immersive 3D environments where users can explore, socialize, and participate in activities.  
- **Digital Ownership**: Blockchain technology enables verifiable ownership of digital assets through NFTs.  
- **Interoperability**: Assets and identities can be transferred across different virtual environments.  
- **Economy and Monetization**: Decentralized marketplaces facilitate trading of virtual goods.  
- **Social Interaction**: Real-time communication and collaboration, including virtual events, conferences, concerts, and gatherings.

### **Examples**

1. **Decentraland**  
   A decentralized virtual world where users can purchase land, build experiences, and monetize content. Land parcels are represented as NFTs (ERC-721 tokens).  

2. **The Sandbox**  
   A community-driven platform where creators can design, share, and monetize voxel assets and gaming experiences. Uses SAND tokens for transactions.  

3. **Cryptovoxels**  
   A virtual world on Ethereum where users can buy land, build, and customize spaces. Focused on art galleries and exhibitions.  

4. **Somnium Space**  
   A VR world with its own economy and currency, allowing users to buy land, build, and interact in VR.
