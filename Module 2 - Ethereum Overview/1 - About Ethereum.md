# About Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a team of co-founders, Ethereum extends the capabilities of blockchain technology beyond simple value transfers, allowing developers to build complex, programmable applications.

Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. Ethereum aims to create a more accessible, transparent, and decentralized internet, often referred to as Web3.

## **Key Innovations**

### **Smart Contracts**
- Self-executing contracts with the agreement terms directly written into code.  
- **Functionality**:
  - Automate agreements without intermediaries.
  - Execute transactions when predefined conditions are met.
- **Impact**: Enable decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and more.

### **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
- A runtime environment for executing smart contracts on Ethereum.  
- **Features**:
  - **Turing-Complete**: Performs any computation given enough resources.
  - **Consistent Execution**: Ensures contracts run identically across nodes.
- **Importance**:
  - Allows developers to write code in high-level languages like Solidity.
  - Facilitates deployment and execution of smart contracts.

### **Token Standards**
- **ERC-20**: For fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and governance tokens.  
- **ERC-721**: For non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art and collectibles.  
- **ERC-1155**: A multi-token standard for fungible and non-fungible assets.  
- **ERC-884**: Tokenizes corporate shares for equity management.
- **ERC-4626**: Tokenized vaults that generate yield on deposited assets

### **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
- Financial services built on blockchain technology, removing intermediaries.  
- **Components**: Lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoins.  
- **Significance**: Expands financial access globally.  

### **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
- Unique digital assets representing ownership of specific items.  
- **Applications**: Digital art, virtual real estate, collectibles, and certifications.

### **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**
- Organizations governed by smart contracts and community consensus.  
- **Functionality**:
  - Enable decentralized decision-making.
  - Manage funds transparently.
  - Allow token holders to vote on proposals.

## **Roadmap and Upgrades**

### **Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)**
- Focuses on scalability, security, and sustainability.  
- **The Merge**: Transitioned Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).  
- **Sharding**: Splits the network into shards to increase capacity.

### **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)**
- Community-driven protocol enhancements.  
- **Process**: Developers and stakeholders propose and discuss upgrades.  
- **Consensus**: Ensures the network evolves with community agreement.

### **Recent Upgrades**
- **The Merge**:
  - Unified Ethereum Mainnet with the PoS Beacon Chain.
  - Reduced energy consumption by ~99.95%.
- **EIP-1559**:
  - Introduced a base fee burned per transaction.
  - Improved fee predictability for users.
