# **ERC-884 (Tokenized Equity / Corporate Shares)**

The ERC-884 standard is a specialized Ethereum token standard designed to represent corporate shares, particularly for Delaware corporations, on the Ethereum blockchain. It brings blockchain technology into the traditional securities and corporate governance ecosystem by integrating identity verification, transfer restrictions, and compliance requirements. By adhering to securities laws and corporate regulations, ERC-884 makes it possible to tokenize equity in a legally compliant manner, offering transparency, efficiency, and automation for corporate share management.

## Key Features

### **1. Identity Verification**
- **KYC/AML Compliance**: Every token holder must undergo **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** verification to ensure they are authorized individuals or entities. This aligns with legal requirements for shareholder identification.
- **Verified Shareholders**: Shareholders are added to a whitelist (verified list) after completing identity verification procedures.
- **Unique Identity Enforcement**: Ensures that no two accounts can hold tokens for the same legal entity, avoiding duplicate or unauthorized ownership records.
  
**Example**:  
Before purchasing shares, a prospective investor provides their identity documents to a verification service. Once verified, their Ethereum address is added to the list of approved shareholders, allowing them to receive shares.

### **2. Transfer Restrictions**
- **Regulatory Enforcement**: ERC-884 enforces transfer rules in compliance with securities regulations, such as SEC regulations for private or public offerings.
- **Whitelisted Transfers**: Tokens can only be transferred to addresses that have been verified and added to the whitelist.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Transfers**: If a shareholder's verification is revoked (e.g., due to regulatory violations), their address can no longer send or receive shares.

**Real-World Use Case**:  
For private corporations, this ensures that shares are only transferred to accredited investors, employees, or other approved parties.

---

### **3. Shareholder Registry**
- **Automatic Updates**: The smart contract maintains an immutable, transparent, and up-to-date record of all shareholders. This registry is automatically updated whenever shares are transferred.
- **Compliance with Corporate Law**: Under Delaware law (or equivalent), corporations are required to maintain an accurate list of shareholders. ERC-884 ensures this requirement is met through blockchain-based automation.
- **Auditable Record**: Since all token transfers and shareholder changes are recorded on-chain, the registry can be audited in real-time for accuracy.

**Benefits**:  
- Removes the need for manual shareholder list maintenance.  
- Enables real-time verification of shareholder composition.

---

### **4. Compliance with Corporate Regulations**
- ERC-884 ensures that tokenized corporate shares adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, particularly for securities under U.S. laws.
- **Restricted Token Cap**: Ensures that the total supply of tokens does not exceed the authorized number of shares specified in the corporate charter.
- **Anti-Fraud Mechanisms**: Prevents unauthorized or fraudulent ownership by enforcing KYC/AML checks.

## Key Functions

### **1. Managing Verified Shareholders**
- `addVerified(address shareholder, uint256 shares)`:  
  Adds a shareholder to the whitelist with a specific number of shares. This function ensures that only verified addresses can hold shares.

- `removeVerified(address shareholder)`:  
  Removes a shareholder from the verified list, restricting their ability to hold or transfer shares. This can be triggered if the shareholder fails to meet legal requirements.

- `isVerified(address shareholder)`:  
  Checks whether a specific address is on the verified whitelist.

### **2. Share Transfer**
- `transfer(address to, uint256 value)`:  
  Transfers a specified number of shares from one verified shareholder to another. If the recipient is not verified, the transfer will fail.

- `totalSupply()`:  
  Returns the total number of issued shares, ensuring compliance with the authorized share limit.

- `balanceOf(address shareholder)`:  
  Returns the number of shares owned by a specific shareholder.

## Events

### **1. Shareholder Verification**
- `VerifiedAddressAdded(address indexed shareholder)`:  
  Emitted when a new shareholder is successfully verified and added to the whitelist.

- `VerifiedAddressRemoved(address indexed shareholder)`:  
  Emitted when a shareholder's verification is revoked.

### **2. Share Transfers**
- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`:  
  Emitted whenever shares are transferred between verified shareholders.

---

## Use Cases

### **1. Tokenizing Corporate Shares or Equity Interests**
- Enables companies to digitize their corporate shares, reducing administrative overhead associated with traditional share certificates.
- Allows easier transfer and management of equity ownership on the blockchain.

### **2. Digitizing Company Stock**
- Streamlines corporate actions like dividends, stock splits, and voting, which can be automated using smart contracts. Shareholders can vote on proposals or receive dividends based on their on-chain share balance.

### **3. Facilitating Regulatory-Compliant Trading**
- Provides liquidity to traditionally illiquid private shares while adhering to securities regulations. Tokenized shares can be traded on approved secondary markets.

### **4. Enhancing Transparency and Trust**
- The blockchain ensures a fully auditable and transparent ledger of all share ownership and transfers. Regulators, auditors, and stakeholders can easily verify the shareholder registry.

**Example**:  
A Delaware startup issues ERC-884 tokens to its investors, employees, and founders. As the company grows, investors can transfer shares to new verified investors, maintaining compliance while providing liquidity.

## Technical and Legal Considerations

- **Whitelisting Mechanism**: Addresses must be verified off-chain before being added to the whitelist on-chain. Off-chain identity verification is typically handled by a third-party service provider.
- **Maximum Token Supply**: The total supply of tokens cannot exceed the authorized shares defined in the corporate charter.
- **Legal Jurisdictions**: While ERC-884 is tailored for Delaware corporations, its principles can be applied in other jurisdictions with similar corporate regulations.
- **Compliance Risks**: Companies must regularly audit their shareholder list to ensure continued compliance with securities laws.
