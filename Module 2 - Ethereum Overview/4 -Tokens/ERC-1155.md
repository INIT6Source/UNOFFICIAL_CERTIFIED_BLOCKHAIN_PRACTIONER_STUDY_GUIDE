# ERC-1155 (Multi-Token Standard)

ERC-1155 enables a single smart contract to manage multiple token types, both fungible and non-fungible, within the same framework. It introduces efficiency improvements over previous token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 by reducing gas costs, supporting batch operations, and enabling more versatile token management.

---

## **Key Features**

### **Single Contract for Multiple Tokens**
- Unlike ERC-20 or ERC-721, ERC-1155 allows multiple token types to coexist within one contract.  
- Each token is identified by a unique ID, representing either fungible, non-fungible, or semi-fungible assets.  
- **Example**: A gaming DApp could use token ID `1` for fungible currency, ID `2` for a unique sword (NFT), and ID `3` for stackable items like potions (semi-fungible).

### **Batch Operations**
- Enables bulk actions like transferring or burning multiple tokens in a single transaction.  
- Simplifies complex operations, such as trading or distributing multiple tokens.
- The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function allows transferring different token types and amounts simultaneously. 

### **Optimized Gas Costs**
- Consolidates logic and storage for multiple tokens into a single contract, significantly reducing deployment and interaction costs.
- Batch Processing saves gas by performing multiple actions in a single operation, ideal for large-scale DApps.

### **Flexible Token Types**
- **Fungible Tokens**: Identical and divisible, e.g., in-game currencies.  
- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Unique and indivisible, e.g., collectibles.  
- **Semi-Fungible Tokens**: Fungible until redeemed, then become unique, e.g., event tickets.

## **Key Functions**

### **Token Balance and Transfer**
- `balanceOf(address account, uint256 id)`: Returns the balance of a specific token ID for an address.  
- `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data)`: Transfers a specific token type and amount to another address safely.  

### **Batch Operations**
- `safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`: Transfers multiple tokens in a single operation.  

### **Approval Management**
- `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Allows an operator to manage all tokens for the caller.  
- `isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator)`: Checks if an operator has approval to manage tokens for an account.  

## **Events**

### **Transfer Events**
- `TransferSingle`: Logs a single token transfer.  
- `TransferBatch`: Logs batch transfers of multiple token types.  

### **Approval Event**
- `ApprovalForAll`: Indicates when an operator’s approval status changes.  

### **Metadata URI**
- `URI`: Emitted when a token’s metadata URI is updated dynamically.

## **Metadata URI**

- ERC-1155 supports dynamic metadata retrieval through a base URI with a `{id}` placeholder, allowing token-specific metadata.

**Example**:  
- Base URI: `https://example.com/metadata/{id}.json`  
- Token ID `1` → `https://example.com/metadata/1.json`  
- Token ID `2` → `https://example.com/metadata/2.json`  

---

## **Use Cases**

### **Gaming Assets**
- Manage in-game currencies, unique weapons, and consumable items within one contract.  
- Enables bulk transfers of items to players or between players.  

### **Digital Collectibles**
- Issue trading cards or collectibles where some items are rare (NFTs) and others are common (fungible).  

### **Marketplace Transactions**
- Batch transfers optimize trading multiple assets, reducing transaction fees and improving user experience.  

### **Real-World Asset Tokenization**
- Represent fungible assets (e.g., stocks) and non-fungible assets (e.g., property titles) within one framework.  

---

## **Additional Features**

### **Interface Compatibility**
- Implements ERC-165 to allow tools and platforms to recognize ERC-1155 contracts.  

### **Safe Transfers**
- Ensures recipient contracts implement `IERC1155Receiver` to prevent accidental token loss.
