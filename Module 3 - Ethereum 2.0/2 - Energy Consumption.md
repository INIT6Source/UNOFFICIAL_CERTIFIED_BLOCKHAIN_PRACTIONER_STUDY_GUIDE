# **Energy Consumption**

Ethereum's transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 significantly reduces the network's energy consumption. This shift addresses environmental concerns associated with the high energy usage of PoW mining.

## **Energy Consumption in Proof of Work**

- **Mining Process**:  
  Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical puzzles, requiring specialized hardware (ASICs, GPUs) that consume significant electricity.  

- **Environmental Impact**:  
  High energy consumption contributes to a larger carbon footprint, leading to sustainability concerns due to reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

## **Reduction in Proof of Stake**

- **Elimination of Mining**:  
  Validators replace miners and are selected based on the amount of ETH they stake.  

- **Energy Efficiency**:  
  Validators require minimal computational resources, reducing Ethereum's energy consumption by approximately **99.95%**.

## **Implications**

1. **Sustainability**:  
   Aligns with global efforts to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.  

2. **Public Perception**:  
   Improves Ethereum's image regarding environmental responsibility.  

3. **Regulatory Compliance**:  
   May mitigate regulatory pressures related to energy usage in blockchain networks.
