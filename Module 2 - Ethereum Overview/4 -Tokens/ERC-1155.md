# **ERC-1155 (Multi-Token Standard)**

The ERC-1155 standard is a powerful and flexible token standard that enables a single smart contract to manage multiple token types—both fungible and non-fungible—within the same framework. It introduces efficiency improvements over previous token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 by reducing gas costs, supporting batch operations, and enabling more versatile token management.

## Key Features

### **1. Single Contract for Multiple Tokens**
- Unlike ERC-20 or ERC-721, where a new contract is required for each token type, ERC-1155 allows multiple token IDs to exist within a single contract. Each token ID can represent a completely different asset, with unique characteristics and metadata.
- **Token IDs**: Each token is differentiated by its unique ID, enabling developers to create an infinite variety of assets without redeploying new contracts.

**Example**:  
In a gaming application, token ID `1` could represent a fungible currency, token ID `2` a unique sword (NFT), and token ID `3` a set of consumables (semi-fungible).

---

### **2. Batch Operations**
- ERC-1155 introduces batch operations, allowing multiple tokens to be transferred or manipulated in a single transaction. This significantly reduces gas fees and improves performance.
- Functions like `safeBatchTransferFrom` enable transferring multiple token types and quantities simultaneously.

**Benefits**:  
- Reduces on-chain transaction congestion.  
- Improves the user experience for bulk transfers (e.g., sending multiple gaming items to a player).  

---

### **3. Optimized Gas Costs**
- By consolidating multiple token types into a single contract and reusing logic and storage, ERC-1155 reduces the cost of deploying and interacting with tokens.
- Shared smart contract code for minting, transferring, and burning tokens ensures efficiency compared to deploying separate contracts for ERC-20 or ERC-721.

**Gas Savings Example**:  
Batch transferring 10 tokens in a single transaction is far cheaper than performing 10 individual ERC-721 transfers.

---

### **4. Flexible Token Types**
ERC-1155 supports different token types within the same contract:

1. **Fungible Tokens**: Tokens identical to one another and divisible (e.g., currencies, points).  
2. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Tokens that are unique and non-divisible (e.g., digital art, collectibles).  
3. **Semi-Fungible Tokens**: Tokens that initially behave as fungible but become unique after an event, like ticket stubs or redeemable items.  

---

## Key Functions

### **1. Token Balance and Transfer**
- `balanceOf(address account, uint256 id)`: Returns the token balance for a specific token ID and address.
- `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data)`: Transfers a specified amount of a specific token ID safely, verifying recipient compatibility.

### **2. Batch Operations**
- `safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`: Performs batch transfers for multiple token IDs and amounts.

### **3. Approval Management**
- `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Grants or revokes an operator's permission to manage all of the caller's tokens.
- `isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator)`: Checks whether an operator has approval to manage the tokens of a specific account.

## Events

### **1. Transfer Events**
- `TransferSingle`: Emitted when a single token is transferred.  
  **Parameters**: `operator`, `from`, `to`, `id`, `value`.  

- `TransferBatch`: Emitted for batch transfers of multiple tokens.  
  **Parameters**: `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, `values`.  

### **2. Approval Event**
- `ApprovalForAll`: Signals when an operator's approval status changes.  

### **3. URI Update**
- `URI`: Emitted when the metadata URI of a token ID changes. This enables dynamic metadata updates.

---

## Metadata URI

ERC-1155 uses a single URI with a placeholder `{id}` for dynamic metadata retrieval based on the token ID. This reduces redundancy and avoids the need to hardcode metadata for each token.

**Example**:  
A base URI like `https://example.com/metadata/{id}.json` dynamically resolves metadata for specific tokens.

- Token ID `1` → `https://example.com/metadata/1.json`  
- Token ID `2` → `https://example.com/metadata/2.json`

---

## Use Cases

### **1. Gaming Assets**
- Manage fungible tokens (e.g., gold coins), non-fungible tokens (e.g., unique weapons), and semi-fungible tokens (e.g., loot boxes or event tickets) in a single smart contract.

### **2. Marketplace Transactions**
- Batch transfers allow marketplaces to handle large orders efficiently with minimal gas costs.

### **3. Tokenized Real-World Assets**
- Represent real-world assets like property deeds, stocks, or commodities where some assets are fungible (e.g., shares), and others are unique (e.g., title deeds).

### **4. Digital Collectibles**
- Efficiently issue and manage collectibles such as trading cards, where some cards are rare (NFTs) and others are common (fungible tokens).

---

## Additional Features

### **1. Interface Compatibility**
- ERC-1155 contracts implement ERC-165 to allow interface identification, enabling seamless interaction with tools and platforms that support ERC-1155.

### **2. Safe Transfers**
- ERC-1155 mandates that contract addresses receiving tokens implement the `IERC1155Receiver` interface, ensuring they can safely handle ERC-1155 tokens. This prevents accidental token loss.
