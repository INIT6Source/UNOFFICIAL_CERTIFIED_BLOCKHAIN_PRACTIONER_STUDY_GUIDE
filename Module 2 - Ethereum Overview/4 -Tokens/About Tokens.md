# Ethereum Tokens

Ethereum tokens are digital assets built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, following specific standards that ensure compatibility and interoperability across the ecosystem. Tokens can represent anything from currencies and loyalty points to assets and access rights. By adhering to established standards, developers can leverage common interfaces, tools, and infrastructures to create, manage, and interact with tokens efficiently.
