# ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Tokens)

The ERC-721 standard defines how to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike fungible tokens, e.g., ERC-20 tokens, where each unit is identical and interchangeable, NFTs are unique, indivisible, and distinguishable from one another. ERC-721 establishes a standardized way to represent ownership and transfer of unique assets.

---

## **Key Features**

### **Uniqueness**
- Each ERC-721 token has a unique identifier called the **Token ID**, which is a `uint256` integer.
- The combination of a **contract address** (unique for each NFT contract) and the **Token ID** ensures global uniqueness.
- Ideal for representing unique assets such as artwork, collectibles, or real estate.
- **Example**: Token ID `1` in a contract might represent a "Mona Lisa NFT," while Token ID `2` represents a "Starry Night NFT."

---

### **Ownership**
- ERC-721 tracks individual ownership of tokens on the blockchain.
- Ownership is linked to a user's Ethereum address, enabling secure, transparent, and tamper-proof ownership.
- Ownership history and provenance are recorded on-chain.
- Immutable records prevent ownership falsification.

---

### **Metadata Extension**
- Each ERC-721 token can include metadata describing its unique attributes, such as name, description, and image.
- The **`tokenURI`** function points to a metadata file stored on centralized (e.g., AWS) or decentralized systems (e.g., IPFS, Arweave).

**Metadata JSON Example**
```json
{
  "name": "Mona Lisa NFT",
  "description": "A unique digital representation of the Mona Lisa.",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmExampleImage",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Leonardo da Vinci" },
    { "trait_type": "Year", "value": "1503" }
  ]
}
```

## **Key Functions**
- **`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the owner of a specific token.  

- **`balanceOf(address owner)`**: Returns the number of NFTs owned by a specific address.  

- **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Transfers ownership of a token from one address to another.  

## **Approval Functions**
- **`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Approves an address to manage a specific token.  

- **`getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the address approved for a token.  

- **`setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`**: Approves or revokes an operator for managing all tokens of the caller.  

## **Events**

- **`Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId)`**: Created when a token's ownership changes.  

- **`Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId)`**: Created when a token is approved for a specific address.  

- **`ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved)`**: Created when an operator is approved or revoked for managing all tokens.

## **Use Cases**

### **Digital Art and Collectibles**
- Artists tokenize their work as NFTs, ensuring verifiable ownership.  
- **Examples**: CryptoKitties, Bored Ape Yacht Club.

### **Real Estate and Asset Tokenization**
- Represent physical assets (e.g., real estate, vehicles) as NFTs for secure, transparent ownership transfer.  

### **Gaming and Virtual Items**
- Use NFTs for in-game items, skins, or characters.  
- **Examples**: Axie Infinity's ERC-721 tokens represent characters that can be traded and used in battles.

### **Identity and Certification**
- NFTs can serve as tamper-proof digital credentials, diplomas, or tickets.

### Metaverse Assets**
- Represent virtual land, buildings, or avatars in blockchain-powered metaverses like Decentraland** or The Sandbox.

## **Advantages**

- Represents distinct, indivisible assets.  
- Immutable ownership history ensures trust.  
- Works seamlessly across marketplaces and platforms.  
- Supports advanced features like royalties and fractional ownership.  

---

## **Limitations**

- Transactions can be expensive during congestion.  
- Managing large numbers of NFTs can be inefficient.  
- Metadata stored off-chain relies on external systems like IPFS or centralized servers.
