# ERC-884 (Tokenized Equity / Corporate Shares)

ERC-884 is designed to represent corporate shares, particularly for Delaware corporations. It brings blockchain technology into the traditional securities and corporate governance ecosystem by integrating identity verification, transfer restrictions, and compliance requirements. By adhering to securities laws and corporate regulations, ERC-884 makes it possible to tokenize equity in a legally compliant manner.

## **Key Features**

### **Identity Verification**
- All token holders undergo **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** verification.  
- Only whitelisted addresses can hold and transfer shares.  
- Duplicate ownership of shares is prevented by enforcing a one-to-one mapping between Ethereum addresses and shareholder identities.
- **Example**: Before purchasing shares, a user must complete identity verification through a service provider. Once verified, their Ethereum address is whitelisted, enabling them to receive and transfer shares.

### **Transfer Restrictions**
- Token transfers are restricted to only verified and whitelisted addresses, aligning with securities laws.  
- If a shareholder no longer meets regulatory requirements, their address can be removed from the whitelist, restricting their ability to transfer shares.  

### **Shareholder Registry**
- Maintains a real-time, immutable record of all shareholders and their respective shareholdings.  
- Automatically updates the registry during transfers, ensuring compliance with legal requirements such as those under Delaware law.  

### **Compliance with Corporate Regulations**
- The total number of tokens does not exceed the authorized shares as defined in the corporate charter.  
- All transactions and shareholder data are recorded on-chain for transparency and legal compliance.

## **Key Functions**

### **Managing Verified Shareholders**
- **`addVerified(address shareholder, uint256 shares)`**: Adds a new shareholder to the whitelist and assigns them shares.  
- **`removeVerified(address shareholder)`**: Revokes verification and restricts the shareholder from transferring or holding shares.  
- **`isVerified(address shareholder)`**: Checks if a specific address is verified.  

### **Share Transfer**
- **`transfer(address to, uint256 value)`**: Transfers a specified number of shares between verified shareholders.  
- **`totalSupply()`**: Returns the total number of issued shares.  
- **`balanceOf(address shareholder)`**: Returns the number of shares held by a shareholder.  

## **Events**

- **`VerifiedAddressAdded(address indexed shareholder)`**: Logs the addition of a new verified shareholder.  
- **`VerifiedAddressRemoved(address indexed shareholder)`**: Logs the removal of a shareholder from the whitelist.  
- **`Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`**: Logs share transfers between verified shareholders.
