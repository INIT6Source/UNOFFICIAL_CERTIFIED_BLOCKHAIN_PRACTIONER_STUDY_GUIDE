# Scalability

Scalability refers to a blockchain's ability to handle an increasing number of transactions efficiently without compromising performance or security. Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, includes several upgrades designed to improve scalability, security, and sustainability.

## **Sharding**
Sharding involves splitting the Ethereum network into multiple partitions called "shards." Each shard is a separate chain, capable of processing its own transactions and smart contracts.
### **Functionality**
  - Allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously across different shards.
  - Significantly enhances the number of transactions the network can handle per second.
### **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring data consistency and security when transactions involve multiple shards.
  - Adds complexity to the network's infrastructure.

## **Layer 2 Solutions**
Layer 2 refers to protocols built on top of the Ethereum base layer (Layer 1) to improve scalability and efficiency.

### **Rollups**
  - **Optimistic Rollups**
    - Assume transactions are valid by default and only perform computation in the event of a challenge (fraud proof).
    - **Examples**: Optimism, Arbitrum.
  - **ZK-Rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups)**
    - Use cryptographic proofs (zero-knowledge proofs) to verify transactions without revealing details.
    - **Examples**: zkSync, Loopring.

### **State Channels**
  - Allow participants to transact off-chain and only record the final state on-chain.
   - **Examples**: Micropayments, gaming.

### **Plasma**
  - Create child chains anchored to the main chain, handling transactions off-chain and periodically committing to the main chain.
  - **Examples**: OMG Network.

## **Benefits**

- From the current ~15 transactions per second (TPS) to potentially thousands.  
- Less congestion leads to lower transaction costs, e.g, gas fees, for users.  
- Faster transaction confirmations improve usability for DApps.

---

## **Challenges**

- Ensuring that scaling solutions do not compromise the network's security.  
- Maintaining decentralization while implementing sharding and Layer 2 solutions.  
- Encouraging developers to build and migrate applications to new scaling platforms.
