# About Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain designed to enable the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a team of co-founders, it extends blockchain technology beyond simple value transfers, empowering developers to build complex, programmable applications. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serves as the medium for paying transaction fees and computational services on the network. By fostering accessibility, transparency, and decentralization, Ethereum aims to shape the foundation of a more equitable internet, often referred to as Web3.

## **Key Innovations**

### **Smart Contracts**
- Self-executing contracts with the agreement terms directly written into code.  

### **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
- A runtime environment for executing smart contracts on Ethereum.  
- Allows developers to write code in high-level languages like Solidity.
- Facilitates deployment and execution of smart contracts.

### **Token Standards**
- **ERC-20**: Fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and governance tokens.  
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art and collectibles.  
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard for fungible and non-fungible assets.  
- **ERC-884**: Tokenized corporate shares for equity management.
- **ERC-4626**: Tokenized vaults that generate yield on deposited assets

### **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
- Financial services built on blockchain technology, removing intermediaries.  

### **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
- Unique digital assets representing ownership of specific items.  

### **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**
- Organizations governed by smart contracts and community consensus.  
- Enable decentralized decision-making.
- Manage funds transparently.
- Allow token holders to vote on proposals.

## **Roadmap and Upgrades**

### **Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)**
- Focuses on scalability, security, and sustainability.  
- **The Merge**: Transitioned Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).  
- **Sharding**: Splits the network into shards to increase capacity.

### **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)**
- Community-driven protocol enhancements.  
- **Process**: Developers and stakeholders propose and discuss upgrades.  
- **Consensus**: Ensures the network evolves with community agreement.

### **Recent Upgrades**
- **The Merge**:
  - Unified Ethereum Mainnet with the PoS Beacon Chain.
  - Reduced energy consumption by ~99.95%.
- **EIP-1559**:
  - Introduced a base fee burned per transaction.
  - Improved fee predictability for users.
