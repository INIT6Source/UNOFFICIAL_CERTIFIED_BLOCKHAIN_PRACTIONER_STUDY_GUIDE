# ERC-884 (Tokenized Equity / Corporate Shares)

The ERC-884 standard is a specialized Ethereum token standard designed to represent corporate shares, particularly for Delaware corporations, on the Ethereum blockchain. It brings blockchain technology into the traditional securities and corporate governance ecosystem by integrating identity verification, transfer restrictions, and compliance requirements. By adhering to securities laws and corporate regulations, ERC-884 makes it possible to tokenize equity in a legally compliant manner, offering transparency, efficiency, and automation for corporate share management.

## **Key Features**

### **Identity Verification**
- **KYC/AML Compliance**: Ensures all token holders undergo **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** verification.  
- **Verified Shareholders**: Only whitelisted addresses can hold and transfer shares.  
- **Unique Identity Enforcement**: Prevents duplicate ownership of shares by enforcing a one-to-one mapping between Ethereum addresses and shareholder identities.
- **Example**: Before purchasing shares, a user must complete identity verification through a service provider. Once verified, their Ethereum address is whitelisted, enabling them to receive and transfer shares.

---

### **Transfer Restrictions**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Restricts token transfers to only verified and whitelisted addresses, aligning with securities laws.  
- **Revocation Capability**: If a shareholder no longer meets regulatory requirements, their address can be removed from the whitelist, restricting their ability to transfer shares.  

---

### **Shareholder Registry**
- Maintains a real-time, immutable record of all shareholders and their respective shareholdings.  
- Automatically updates the registry during transfers, ensuring compliance with legal requirements such as those under Delaware law.  

---

### **Compliance with Corporate Regulations**
- **Token Cap**: Ensures that the total number of tokens does not exceed the authorized shares as defined in the corporate charter.  
- **Auditable**: All transactions and shareholder data are recorded on-chain for transparency and legal compliance.

### **Share Transfer**
- **`transfer(address to, uint256 value)`**: Transfers a specified number of shares between verified shareholders.  
- **`totalSupply()`**: Returns the total number of issued shares.  
- **`balanceOf(address shareholder)`**: Returns the number of shares held by a shareholder.
