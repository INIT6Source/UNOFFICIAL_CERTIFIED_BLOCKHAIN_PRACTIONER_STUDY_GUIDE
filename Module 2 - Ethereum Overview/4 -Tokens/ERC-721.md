# **ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

The **ERC-721** standard is a key Ethereum token standard that defines how to create **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**. Unlike fungible tokens (e.g., ERC-20 tokens), where each unit is identical and interchangeable, NFTs are **unique, indivisible, and distinguishable** from one another. ERC-721 establishes a standardized way to represent ownership and transfer of unique assets, fostering interoperability across wallets, marketplaces, and decentralized applications (DApps).

## Key Features

### **1. Uniqueness**
- Each ERC-721 token has a unique identifier called the **Token ID**, which is a `uint256` integer.
- The combination of a **contract address** (unique for each NFT contract) and the **Token ID** ensures that each NFT is globally unique.
- This feature makes ERC-721 ideal for representing assets where uniqueness or individuality matters, such as artwork, collectibles, or real estate.

**Example**:  
A contract may represent a series of digital artworks. Token ID `1` could represent a "Mona Lisa NFT," and Token ID `2` could represent a "Starry Night NFT."

---

### **2. Ownership**
- ERC-721 tracks ownership of each token individually. Ownership can be transferred securely and transparently on the blockchain.
- Ownership rights are linked to a user's Ethereum address, allowing token holders to **prove ownership** without relying on intermediaries.

**Core Ownership Benefits**:
- **Transparency**: Ownership history and transfers are recorded on the blockchain, providing a public ledger of provenance.
- **Security**: Ownership cannot be falsified or tampered with due to blockchain immutability.

---

### **3. Metadata Extension**
- ERC-721 tokens can include metadata to describe the unique attributes of the asset, such as its name, description, image, and other details.
- The **`tokenURI` function** returns a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) pointing to a metadata file, typically stored on:
  - Centralized servers (e.g., AWS)
  - Decentralized networks (e.g., IPFS, Arweave)

**Metadata JSON Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "Mona Lisa NFT",
  "description": "A unique digital representation of the Mona Lisa.",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmExampleImage",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Leonardo da Vinci" },
    { "trait_type": "Year", "value": "1503" }
  ]
}

---

### **4. Approval Mechanism**
- Owners can grant permission for another Ethereum address to manage their tokens without transferring ownership.
- This is useful in scenarios where third parties, such as NFT marketplaces, need temporary control over a user's NFT.

**Approval Functions**:
- **`approve`**: Approves a specific address to manage a specific token.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Allows an address (e.g., a marketplace) to manage **all tokens** owned by the caller.

---

## Functions

### **1. Core Functions**
- `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`:  
  Returns the owner address of the specified token ID.

- `balanceOf(address owner)`:  
  Returns the total number of NFTs owned by a specific address.

- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`:  
  Transfers ownership of a token from one address to another.

---

### **2. Approval Functions**
- `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`:  
  Approves an address to manage a specific token ID.

- `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`:  
  Returns the address approved to manage a specific token.

- `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`:  
  Approves or revokes an operator to manage all tokens of the caller.

- `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`:  
  Returns whether an operator is approved to manage all tokens of an owner.

---

## Events

- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId)`:  
  Emitted when ownership of a token changes.

- `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId)`:  
  Emitted when an address is approved to manage a specific token.

- `ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved)`:  
  Emitted when an operator is approved or revoked to manage all of a userâ€™s tokens.

---

## Use Cases

### **1. Digital Art and Collectibles**
- Artists can tokenize their works into ERC-721 tokens, creating unique, verifiable ownership of digital art.
- Examples: **CryptoKitties**, **Bored Ape Yacht Club**, and **Art Blocks**.

---

### **2. Real Estate and Asset Tokenization**
- Physical assets like real estate, luxury items, or vehicles can be represented as NFTs to prove ownership and enable fractionalized ownership.

**Example**:  
A house can be represented as an NFT, where ownership transfers securely via blockchain.

---

### **3. Gaming and Virtual Items**
- NFTs can represent in-game items, skins, or characters. Unlike traditional games, blockchain-based games allow players to truly own their digital assets and trade them outside the game.

**Example**:  
**Axie Infinity** uses ERC-721 tokens to represent collectible characters (Axies) that players can breed, trade, and battle.

---

### **4. Identity and Certification**
- NFTs can be used to verify identity or credentials such as diplomas, certificates, or event tickets.
- Immutable ownership ensures authenticity.

---

### **5. Metaverse Assets**
- Virtual land, buildings, and avatars in blockchain-powered metaverses like **Decentraland** or **The Sandbox** are represented as NFTs, enabling ownership and trade of virtual properties.

## Advantages of ERC-721

1. **Uniqueness**: Each token has distinct properties, making it ideal for assets that require individuality.  
2. **Provenance and Ownership**: Transparent and immutable ownership history ensures authenticity.  
3. **Interoperability**: Standardization allows NFTs to work seamlessly across platforms, wallets, and marketplaces.  
4. **Programmability**: Smart contracts enable advanced use cases, such as royalties or fractional ownership.  

---

## Limitations of ERC-721

1. **Gas Costs**: Transferring NFTs can be expensive during network congestion.  
2. **Scalability**: Managing individual NFTs in bulk can be inefficient.  
3. **Off-Chain Dependencies**: Metadata or assets stored off-chain (e.g., on IPFS) rely on external services for availability and durability.
