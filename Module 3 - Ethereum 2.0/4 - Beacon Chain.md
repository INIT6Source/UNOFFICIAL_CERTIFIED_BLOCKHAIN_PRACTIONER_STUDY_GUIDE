# Beacon Chain

The Beacon Chain is a core component of Ethereum 2.0, introduced to implement Proof of Stake (PoS). Launched on December 1, 2020, it runs in parallel to the original Ethereum PoW chain and coordinates the network of validators, manages the PoS protocol, and lays the groundwork for future scalability improvements like sharding.

## **Functions**

### **Consensus Layer**
   - Manages the PoS protocol, ensuring validators reach consensus on the state of the blockchain.

### **Validator Management**
   - Handles the registration, activation, and removal of validators, along with stakes and rewards.

### **Randomness Source**
   - Provides secure randomness (RANDAO) for validator selection and sharding assignments.

### **Sharding Coordination**
   - Will oversee the implementation and synchronization of shard chains in future upgrades.

## **Technical Details**

### **Slots**
- A 12-second period during which a validator can propose a block.  

### **Epochs**
- Consists of 32 slots (~6.4 minutes). 
- At the end of each epoch, the chain finalizes and applies rewards and penalties.

### **Justification and Finalization**:  
- Uses Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) to achieve finality.  
- Once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted unless a significant portion of validators are penalized.

## **Validator Participation**

### **Staking Requirements**
- Minimum of 32 ETH staked to become a validator.

### **Responsibilities**
- Propose new blocks when selected.  
- Validate and attest to blocks proposed by others.

### **Rewards** 
- Validators earn rewards for active participation in block proposal and attestation.

### **Penalties**
- Penalized for being offline.  
- Penalized for malicious behavior such as double-signing or equivocating.
